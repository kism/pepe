This script downloads the Matt Furie Pepe collection.

I hate NFTs as a concept, imo it's all a Ponzi scheme.

I will always hate on any crypto currentcy that is:
1. A ponzi scheme (all of them) 
2. Uses a proof of work algorithm

This collection has some really nice animations though, I think Matt is working with whoever did the animations for the 'Feels Good Man' documentary.

I made this to scrape all the NFT assets of this collection.

Racists can GTFO, Pepe has been reclaimed by the sane.
